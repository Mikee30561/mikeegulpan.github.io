                                In the second photo, you can see I already Change the theme to the color that I want, and as defult in android emulator, the text "Hello World" is in the left side, so by using "Target Platofrm.Ios" 
                                it is now in the center. As you can see in the first photo, there is a red debug in the upper right screen of emulator. I learned how to remove it as you can see in the second photo.
                                 In the third, I added some padding and assign a color on it, it is not cover of chapter 2, but since I browse through the Internet , I learned about it and apply it in my emulator in advanced.</p>
