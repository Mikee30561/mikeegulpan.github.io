							<p>Chapter 7, is all about adding Animation to an App. This chapters taught me how to use the Animated container, animated crossfade,
								AnimatedOpacity, Animated Controller, and Animation Controller as what can you see in the above photos. In the first photo in the top with the text"tap
								to grow width" it is Animated Container app that width grows everytime you tap it. And the following photos are the AnimatedCrossFade and Opacity.  
								There is also a balloon, you can see it right? Yeah  it is the one I've struggle with, cause even I followed the code in the book and search 
								how to grow the balloon as it goes up, it still doesn't grow. Maybe beacuse I am using VScode and not Android studio, I'll try it in other time. But still as you can see
								in photo I able to animate it to goes upward.
